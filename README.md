# family-fair-allocation
Algorithms for democratic fair allocation of items among families and other groups.

To demonstrate a protocol from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02564),
run one of the following:

    python3 rwav_demo_2families.py
    python3 rwav_demo_3families.py
    python3 enhanced_rwav_demo.py
    python3 twothirds_demo.py
    python3 line_demo_2families.py
    python3 line_demo_3families.py
    python3 plurality_demo.py

Code for exhaustive search of counter-examples for the 2/3 conjecture can be run here:

    python3 twothirds_exhaustive_search.py

You can edit the demo files to change the instance details.
